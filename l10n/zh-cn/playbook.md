# 在线活动攻略 

创建这个在线活动攻略是为了帮助个人规划面向开发者的在线活动，然而它可以被复制并用于任何类型的参与者。

## 转向在线活动
作为有影响力的活动组织者和贡献者，我们必须共同协作来应对COVID-19导致的向在线体验的转变，以及实现全球规模化的愿望。在线活动可以通过可伸缩的内容、包容性和可访问性、流程和策略的一致性、品牌塑造和推广招募来增强。

**请注意，并非所有活动都是适用于所有人的。要素可能需要根据受众、内容和事件的期望结果进行轻微修改。本攻略代表了一套已经成功验证过的策略。**

## 在线活动的关键要素 
**多元化和包容性**：包容性的活动体验必须从包容性和多元化的策划过程开始。这是一个机会，鼓励不同的观点，扩大发声，增加创新，并在一个活动中产生更多的结果。

**核心内容**：用于告知、激励和教育受众的内容。这些都是以视频为中心的体验，比如主题演讲，还有简单的互动环节，比如投票和聊天。

**间歇式节目**：活动体验的预留部分，为体验增加活力和乐趣。节目可能包括采访、表演、健康、慈善、测验和游戏。

**交互式互动**：以交互的方式进行核心内容的演讲。包括通常有主持人和受众参与，并可能包括产品反馈焦点小组，专家联系和个性化咨询。

**聚会/社区建设**：在组织数字化在线活动时，“联系”是最重要的优先事项，以支持社交、建立关系，以及从每次活动中获得长期结果。这更多的是由观众和与会者引导，以促进自然协作和信任。

## 在线活动的标准要求 
**Event Registration**: An inclusive, accessible, and informative registration process to communicate the desired audience, content, and event logistics is key in generating attendance and low attrition.  

**活动注册**：一个包容的、可访问的和信息丰富的注册流程，以沟通所需的受众、内容和活动的后勤是产生出席率和降低损耗的关键。

Popular and widely used examples include: 
* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com): Offer workshops, presentations, and networking events over Meetup. Meetup has a very large, active community of users that can be leveraged to grow demand for your event. 
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/l/online-event-resources/?mkwid=UtKYFHIu_dc&pcrid=79989571666430&pkw=eventbrite&pmt=be&plc&_bk=eventbrite&_bt=79989571666430&_bm=e&_bn=o&msclkid=ab20c0317bbb173229d69eeff0c24676&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Croud_US_SEM_EN_Brand%20Core_Exact&utm_term=eventbrite&utm_content=Core&gclid=CNiW_an08ukCFYNjfgodDK0O6A&gclsrc=ds): Social platform for hosting and registering for events. One of the most popular Meetup alternatives. Easy and quick steps to create an event, set up pricing and logistics, and then share on other social media platforms. Audiences can use Eventbrite’s search engine to find events, but the organizers need to be proactive in their demand generation strategy.
* [LinkedIn Events](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/98189/linkedin-events-overview?lang=en): LinkedIn members and page owners can use the LinkedIn Events feature to find and build communities, generate interest in various events, and create long-term relationships with community members. 
* [SplashThat](https://splashthat.com/): Event marketing and registration site geared towards companies and organizations that want to measure, manage, and market their various event offerings on one platform. 

**Demand Generation**: A successful demand generation strategy drives people to register and attend an event, where we deliver a phenomenal experience that motivates them to engage with us (or our content) afterwards. This positive end-to-end experience increases their propensity to attend future events and share with friends and colleagues. 

* Pre-Event Execution: 
  * Quality registration system and way to announce the event 
  * Clearly define the target audience for the event series and each event individually. Focus first on individuals that have attended in the past, then local groups that have a strong relationship with the event organizers, and then focus on new attendees.  
  * List the criteria of your audience – Job Role, Region, and OK to contact. 
  * Prepare invite templates to send immediately when contacts are identified 
  * Ensure the Code of Conduct is on the event site and easily accessible 
  * Social media and outreach strategy before, during, and after each event 
    * (Before) Use prior third-party Meetup hosts to share events 
    * (Before) Use third-party groups, event calendars, and accelerators to share events (ex: New Tech Seattle posts local events on their site for free) 
    * (Before) Get contacts/organizations to help amplify on their social channels 
    * (Before & After) Post articles and event listings on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and relevant social sites 
    * (Before, During, After) Use established social media outlets and strategies to build hype, share photos and content throughout, and the success of the event with post-communication information, learnings, and future events to stay connected 
  * Four days (on average) before the event, send a pre-event email to registrants reviewing logistics, pre-read materials, and ways to connect with the speaker(s) and/or local team. 

* On-Site Execution: 
  * Provide detailed instructions on the schedule, how to navigate the event, where to go if you have a technical issue, where to go if you have a non-technical issue, and any other relevant information to make the experience as smooth as possible  
  * Share and reference the Code of Conduct and ways to enforce it.  
    * Ex: Create a welcome deck template (customizable per event) that links to consistent language. Share the Code of Conduct within the chats and pin them where applicable  
  * Offer dedicated time for the audience and speakers to network with each other -- and fun ways to stay connected afterwards (“bringing the event home”). 
    * Ex: Swag with event page links or social handle.  
  * Make attendees feel included and comfortable (speakers play a big role here!)  
    * Ex: Provide a 5-minute opportunity to introduce yourself and use the chat to have people start socializing 
  * Deliver creative, unique content that focuses on education and growth. If technical in nature, give the audience a way to interact with relevant tools. 
    * Ex. Provide Azure Passes to give attendees a low-friction way to try it themselves. 

* Post-Event Execution: 
  * Send a post-event email/notification to all individuals who checked in, thanking them for attending, providing relevant session materials, and sharing info about future events. 
  * Include a short survey on how to improve, such as desired topics for future events, ways to make the event more inclusive, and logistical feedback (e.g., more accessible timing). 
  * Measure the number of people who interacted with the prospective advertising outlets like Meetup, Twitter, and Dev Newsletter unique clicks to assess the number of people receiving the event information vs. the number of people who attended.  
  * Analyze what events bring new attendees and the number of repeat attendees and use the learned data to continue iterating on ways to get in front of large groups of developers. 
  * Focus on using partner groups and cross-posting vs. email blasts and paid ads. 

**Checklists**: Have a checklist to ensure all action items have been completed. Checklist items may include:  

* determining the date and time 
* finalizing the topics and speakers 
* finalizing the schedule 
* committing to the event platform 
* working on demand generation and social media campaigns 
* perform dry runs for all the participants including speakers, moderators, and event organizers 
* execute successful event 
* send follow up items like swag when applicable, survey, send thank you notes to participants 
* connect with attendees on how to follow up and remain engaged 
* analyze survey results and review learnings for the next event 

**Staff/Speaker Training**: All staff, presenters, and moderators must complete accessibility and inclusion training. Please utilize the various reminders below to ensure speakers and presenters are prepared and supported. 

* Accessibility and Inclusion Reminders 
  * Experiences must be accessible to all and designed to enable and support the full range of human diversity. This includes creating content with closed captions, color contrast 4:5:1, livestream captions, play/pause control, audio description tracks, and transcripts. 
  * Share the agenda, session objectives beforehand, and pre-reads to help the audience prepare, especially those that require additional time. 
  * Use PowerPoint subtitles (slide show > check “Always use subtitles” > select “Spoken language” and “Subtitle language”) and videos/streams with subtitles 
  * Check accessibility for shared material (Review > “Check Accessibility” > Solve results errors and warnings) 
  * Be simple in your language, avoid using acronyms, verbally describe photos, and offer a question and answer opportunity for the audience. 
    * Facilitate Q&A to ensure everyone can feel heard and solicit questions ahead of time, if possible.  
  * Do not make any assumptions about the audience. For example, reduce the use of pronouns where applicable and do not assume a person’s pronoun when communicating with them.  

* Recording Reminders 
  * Physically plug in your computer to an outlet and use a wired network connection 
  * Close all unnecessary programs and turn off all notifications on computer and nearby devices 
  * Find a quiet location and smaller space with soft walls like curtains to ensure sufficient sound quality  
  * Use a headset microphone if possible as well as a good webcam that should be stable and at or above eye level 
  * Reduce clutter in the background and avoid anything distracting in the room 
  * Presenter wardrobe should be solid colors, not white, and avoid prints, logos, or excessive jewelry  
  * Prepare, practice, and add extra enthusiasm so your energy translates through the screen 

**Code of Conduct**: All events **must** have an active and public facing Code of Conduct. Any incidents should be documented and reported immediately. 

**Virtual Swag**: Virtual Swag is a great way to enhance the attendee experience and grow brand awareness in an accessible and sustainable way. Consider the following when making your selections:

* have attendees work for swag like completing a simple task to promote engagement 
* keep sustainability in mind like providing application subscriptions, E-books, online learning, and downloadable “parent packets”  
* relevance to the audience 
* support local/social enterprises 

**Event Evaluations & Activity Reports**: To ensure we evolve and continue to iterate on tooling, content, and processes, we must continue to evaluate each digital experience, openly share learnings, and achieve the reporting. The evaluation process and specific data points considered will shift based on learnings and a changing environment. 

## 平台指南

Research shows that attention span in a digital environment lasts 2 – 3 hours. Therefore, the content 1) must be recorded for future consumption, 2) offer live moderators to facilitate a personal experience and real-time answers, and 3) incorporate breaks and engagement throughout, for example yoga and polling during a session. Organizers should strive to provide the similar perks of a live experience (reference Key Digital Event Elements section), while recognizing that live interaction cannot be fully replicated.  

**Teams Live**: Users can broadcast video and meeting content to large online audiences for four hours straight. The attendees can watch the live or recorded event and interact with the presenters using moderated Q&A. 

Quick Facts:

* Accessibility: Languages supported by Teams Live Event captioning (as of April 20, 2020: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmal, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese) 
* Length: 4 hours 
* Capacity: Up to 10,000 attendees 
* Attendee Experience: Limited execution modalities (live or broadcast) and limited attendee engagement experiences (only participate over moderated text) 
* Invitation: Calendar invitation or sharing the URL link directly to the Teams Live Event

**Teams Meetings**: Users can broadcast video and meeting content to a small to medium-sized audience for up to 12 hours. The attendees enjoy an interactive experience to watch live or recorded content with open chat. Moderators must be very attentive in this setting, since attendees can quickly communicate back and forth and conversations can go quite fast, unmanaged.  

Quick Facts:

* Accessibility: Languages similarly supported by PowerPoint captioning (as of April 20, 2020: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmal, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish) 
* Length: 12 hours 
* Capacity: Up to 250 attendees  
* Attendee Experience: Allows for real-time collaboration and conversation 
* Invitation: Calendar invitation or sharing the URL link directly to the Teams Meeting

## 额外的平台和步骤

**Step 1: Conference Schedule Building** 

* [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/): setup CFP, conference agenda, content and speaker management, mobile and web app available for event organizers and attendees. Free for communities/~$500 for each organization/professional event. Easy integration to custom domain.  
  * Example: [https://live.globalai.community/](https://live.globalai.community/) - This entire event is built on Sessionize and then exported to this domain. 

**Step 2: Event Registration**

 * [SplashThat](https://splashthat.com/): Full event website/domain with branded landing page, event registration, schedule, speaker profiles, confirmation emails, guest list management and event check-in. Free version available with splash branding in corner. 
 * [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/microsoft-reactor/): Perfect for creating events if you already have a group created. Easily discoverable based on categories and easy outreach to people currently in your meetup group.  
 * [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/l/online-event-resources/?mkwid=UtKYFHIu_dc&pcrid=79989571666428&pkw=eventbrite&pmt=be&plc&_bk=eventbrite&_bt=79989571666428&_bm=e&_bn=o&msclkid=16cbfaf5116a158b929ea4073a71ab93&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Croud_US_SEM_EN_Brand%20Core_Exact&utm_term=eventbrite&utm_content=Core&gclid=CI3NmpOrmOoCFYQLfwodr-UPgA&gclsrc=ds): single event listing page with customized registration options. Easily discoverable through the Eventbrite website search. Free events have no administrator fees.  

**Step 3: Behind-The-Scenes Production**

 * [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/): a live video production tool in your browser with 3 different pricing levels to meet your needs. User friendly view for attendees with built-in chat. Streams to multiple platforms (Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Periscope, Twitch, and custom RTMP outputs) and syncs comments between these platforms. Limited to 6 simultaneous presenters.  
 * [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/): free and open-source software for video recording and live streaming. Best for seasoned virtual event presenters as OBS Studio is equipped with a powerful API, enabling a highly customizable professional production. Hardware requirements are more robust than StreamYard.  

**Step 4: Event Location (live streaming and/or pre-recorded content)** 

 * [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/live): Videos tend to rank relatively high when searching on Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The searchability and SEO are a top benefit, as well as the ability to send an email and push notifications in the app. Chat is open and you can have the livestream public, unlisted or private. Easy integration to share in real time over social channels. 
 * [Learn TV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/tv/): Stream on Microsoft Learn and provide ways for your audience to already be ready to explore everything that Microsoft Learn can offer after each session and/or event.
 * [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/): Millions of viewers log in daily to chat, interact, and make entertainment together. Great platform to live stream and has a growing developer audience when primarily was a gaming platform. 
 * Website/domain with videos and sessions embedded on the website using Vimeo or other video streaming sites. 
 * [Twitter/Periscope](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-live): Presenter(s) must use mobile app to go live. Your followers are alerted when you go live, and anyone can view the stream without having to register. 

**Step 5: Community Engagement & Chat**

 * [Discord](https://discord.com/new): Preferred for chat experience and watercooler. Similar user interface to Slack and a great addition to other platforms when looking to create community experiences within text and video communication. Not the best for mobile users due to bandwidth.  

**Additional Platforms:**

* [Zoom](https://restream.io/blog/how-to-multistream-with-zoom/#zoom-basic-account) - Widely recognized platform for community driven experiences – live chat, video and audio attendee use, and known for reliability. Lots of versatility for meetings, webinars, and conferences/breakouts, however, the capacity if 1,000 video participants and 10,000 viewers.  
* [On24](https://www.on24.com/) - Large amount of engagement tools including embedded media player, information, live chat, slide/presentation view, and resource lists. Really interesting and engaging user experience when attempting to “recreate” the live experience in a digital landscape. 
* [StreamElements](https://docs.streamelements.com/docs) - Platform for live streamers using Twitch and YouTube to enhance the viewer experience. It includes overlay management, chatbots, tipping, alerts, and loyalty. 
* [Facebook Live](https://restream.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-facebook-live-streaming/) - Not as easily found as YouTube streams and has lower quality and length capabilities. However, since Facebook is the most popular social media platform, you can leverage current audiences to promote engagement and easier to begin demand generation efforts. Additionally, it has more notifications built in to remind you audience that the stream is coming up in 1 hour, 20 minutes, and 1 minute vs. YouTube’s email and push notifications. Great platform if just starting out! 
* [Instagram Live](https://help.instagram.com/292478487812558) - Many people prefer Instagram over Facebook; therefore, the demographic is a bit more visually oriented and has a younger audience. A disadvantage though is that you can only go live with the mobile app, therefore, you need to prepare on how to manage that when filming. 
* [Hopin.To](https://hopin.to/): Various ways to connect including stages, one-on-ones, sessions, and expos. Provides the solution of not needing to use multiple platforms, since it provides everything to host a full event experience in a digital landscape. Appears to be one of the best platforms when trying to replicate a live experience when reviewing their “watercooler” offerings and expo booths.  
* [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/): Virtual reality experience to host live events and connect with members of the community. Operates both with and without a headset. Owned by Microsoft and part of the Windows Mixed Reality experience and unique offering to audience members to have an avatar, attend events, and meet community members all around the globe.
