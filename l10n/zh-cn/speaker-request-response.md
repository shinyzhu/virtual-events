# Speaker Request Response 

## Objective 
We receive requests to speak, sponsor, and partner on events and experiences every single day. With the current shift to primarily virtual experiences, the number of requests has increased and the timeframe between the request and the event has decreased. This tight timeline often makes it more difficult for speakers and partners to ensure that our standards for engaging are met, specifically around diversity and inclusion.  

To enable each speaker to ensure these standards are maintained, below is a drafted email that can be sent in response to these sorts of requests without yet identifying your decision on whether to participate. 

## Process 
First impressions and representation matter! Though what’s visible from a speaker lineup page is of course not the entire story, it does serve as a first impression for both potential speakers and attendees. We are striving to cultivate a sense of belonging. We ask that in addition to the explicit guidance below, you use your best judgment with the following considerations. 

* Considerations:  
  * Have the organizers given enough time for you to review and to implement meaningful changes if needed? 
  * Do you have available emotional labor and time to partner with the organizers if they request your assistance? 
  * Please be cognizant that cultural norms differ by region, and that representation can look different in different parts of the world.   
* Before accepting the invitation, email the organizer with below response if you are not 100% confident in their commitment towards a fully inclusive event 
  * Personalize the highlighted portions at the very minimum 
* Provide inclusive virtual event resources located on [Virtual Events Github Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/virtual-events) if needed 
* Review and verify their commitment toward diversity and inclusion on website and outward engagement within the community (See Final Review section) 
* Communicate the event’s commitment toward diversity and inclusion post event with applicable members of your internal team and various Code of Conduct/D&I team(s) to document for future awareness. 
  * If Code of Conduct violations or exclusive incidents occur, reports should be directed to your designated team and thoroughly documented. This documentation can be used internally for decisions to partner again or actions required by the organizers before partnering again in the future. 

## Email Draft 
Dear [Insert: Requestor Name], 

Thank you for inviting me to [Insert: Requested Action (example: speak, participate, sponsor, partner)] at [Insert: Conference Name]. As I review my availability and your event objectives, please note that the [Insert: Your Speaker Team] requires the following elements to be in place prior to participating in any event. 

Standard Event Expectations include:  
1. An active, enforced, and public facing Code of Conduct. 
2. An objective and inclusive Call for Proposals (CFP) process if applicable.

As members of the technology industry and community, we must partner to ensure that diversity and inclusion is the number one priority. **Please respond with your commitment towards achieving the above expectations and any relevant examples and/or links.** Here are [additional resources](https://github.com/microsoft/virtual-events/blob/main/inclusive-planning-process.md) that may be helpful.

## Final Review 
After the email response has been sent, please take the time to confirm the following to your own personal satisfaction. If you feel the requestor is committed to the Standard Event Expectations [found here](https://github.com/microsoft/virtual-events/blob/main/playbook.md) and the below have been addressed; your participation reflects your confidence that the event will represent the commitments outlined within this document. 
* Active and public-facing Code of Conduct, as well as reporting mechanisms and incident resolution practices. This is often displayed as a team and/or specific members of the organizing committee being referenced as the “owners” of Code of Conduct enforcement.  
* The organizer responds to the email with key examples of how they have met the standard event requirements. 
* Publicly share your involvement with members of your team to ensure any issues have had time to be addressed. 
* After committing, speaking, and/or attending the event, document your feedback with your team to ensure that the requirements were truly met. Measure your future involvement based on their commitment towards diversity and inclusion specifically. 
  * If Code of Conduct violations or exclusive incidents occur, reports should be directed to your designated team and thoroughly documented. This documentation can be used internally for decisions to partner again or actions required by the organizers before partnering again in the future.
